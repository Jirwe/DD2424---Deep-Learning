# DD2424---Deep-Learning
Folders including the four assignments for DD2424 at KTH written in python.

The python files include sub-parts that can be commented and uncommented so as to run individual sub-assignments or everything in one go, as desired.

An additional caveat is that the required data files for the python files to run appropriately is not included in the repository. This is the CIFAR-10 dataset for assignment 1-3 and the Goblet of Fire text file for assignment 4.
